Average_mean_x: For each participant in each activity, we have taken the average out of all the observations for the mean of the body acceleration signals on the x-axis.

Average_mean_y: For each participant in each activity, we have taken the average out of all the observations for the mean of the body acceleration signals on the y-axis.

Average_mean_z: For each participant in each activity, we have taken the average out of all the observations for the mean of the body acceleration signals on the z-axis.

Average_std_x: For each participant in each activity, we have taken the average out of all the observations for the standard deviation of the body acceleration signals on the x-axis.

Average_std_y: For each participant in each activity, we have taken the average out of all the observations for the standard deviation of the body acceleration signals on the y-axis.

Average_std_z: For each participant in each activity, we have taken the average out of all the observations for the standard deviation of the body acceleration signals on the z-axis.
